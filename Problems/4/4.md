# Notes problem 4

Largest number that can be created by a multiplication of two three digit numbers is 999 * 999 = 998001.
This number has 6 digits. So the palindrome has a max size of 6 digits.

Brute force solution is to have a two nested for loops increment the first and second numbers, this wil result in 998001 loops.

Too check if a number is palindrome a for loop needs to be implemented that checks the left most number to the right most number, and than L+1 and R-1, and so forth.
If one of the compares does not match it is not a palindrome. If a palindrome is found the two three digit numbers should be stored until a larger pair is found.

I assume that 00x * 00x and 0xx * 0xx do not count as three digit numbers, they probably do not result in a high palindrome either,  so the for loop should start with 100 * 100.
